# Khumba (PHP Framework)

Khumba is a lightweight, pragmatic PHP framework designed for long-term stability and simplicity.

It combines the speed and minimal structure of CodeIgniter with selected modern practices inspired by early Laravel, without heavy abstractions or deep directory hierarchies. Khumba supports backward compatibility (PHP N, N-1, N-2), uses a flat two-level MVC structure, and runs well on legacy servers and shared hosting.

Up to this phase, Khumba provides a working bootstrap, simple MVC routing, centralized configuration, dynamic URL handling, basic request helpers, a lightweight PDO database layer, minimal templating with layouts, and essential security features such as XSS escaping and CSRF protection.

Khumba focuses on practicality: clear code, low maintenance cost, and features added only when they solve real problems.
